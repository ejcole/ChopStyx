I've started a pycharm project for us. 

To open it:

1. open pycharm
2. click file, then click open (press alt+f, then alt+o)
3. navigate into our repo (where ever you saved it on the hdd)
4. find the Python folder...
5. Select the python folder (not the folders inside) and open that folder as the the project.
	-there should be a .idea within the folder that is our project
